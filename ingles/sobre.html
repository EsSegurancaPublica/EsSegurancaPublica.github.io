    <p>Public safety is the state of normality that allows the usufruct of rights and the fulfillment of duties, its illegitimate alteration constituting a violation of basic rights, usually accompanied by violence, which produces events of insecurity and crime. It is a process, that is, a continuous sequence of facts or operations that present a certain unity or that reproduce with a certain regularity, that shares a vision focused on preventive, repressive, judicial, health and social components. It is a systemic process, due to the need to integrate a set of state knowledge and tools that should interact with the same vision, commitments and objectives. </p> <p> It must also be optimized, since it depends on quick decisions, sanitation measures and results Immediate. Since public order is a state of serenity, appeasement and public tranquility, in keeping with the laws, precepts and customs that regulate coexistence in society, the preservation of this citizen's right will only be ample if the Concept of public safety is applied.</p> <br>

The Federal Police is a Brazilian police institution, subordinated to the Ministry of Justice, whose function, according to the 1988 Constitution, is to exercise public security for the preservation of public order and the safety of persons, as well as the assets and interests of the Union, carrying out maritime, airport and border police activities, repression of narcotics trafficking, smuggling and misconduct, and exercising exclusively the functions of the Union's judicial police.</p>

<p>The Federal Police, according to article 144, paragraph 1, of the Federal Constitution, is established by law as a permanent body, organized and maintained by the Union and structured in a career.</p>

<p>This, in addition to guarding national borders - preventing the entry of weapons, drugs or contraband - is responsible for investigating crimes that affect the country as a whole. For example, so-called "white collar" crimes (corruption), crimes against the financial system, etc.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Federal Police is located in Brasília, in the Federal District, with decentralized units (regional superintendencies) in all the capitals of the states of the federation, as well as police stations and outposts in several cities of the country. Since January 14, 2011, the General Directorate has been held by delegate Leandro Daiello Coimbra.</p>

<p>The Civil Police is headed by Police Officers, who coordinate the activities of the Agents. Each state has a different Civil Police, and they act investigating and elucidating crimes that occur within the territorial limits of the respective state, but can happen to fulfill missions outside, for example, arresting a criminal who committed a crime in Rio, but went to hide In Goiás. In this case, the Rio Civil Police must inform the Civil Police of Goiás that it is carrying out a mission in its territory.</p>

<p>As regards their duties, the Civil Police has several functions. It is responsible for overseeing various activities, such as authorizing major events and operating certain commercial activities. But the most important activity is undoubtedly the investigation and elucidation of crimes committed in its territory.</p>
