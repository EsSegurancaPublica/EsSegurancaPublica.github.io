On February 3, 2017, in the morning, relatives of the police protested in front of the military battalion of the Feu Rosa, Serra neighborhood, preventing the departure of vehicles. These occurrences happened also in regions of Jaaraípe, New Almeida, Manguinhos and Vila Nova de Colares where according to the police the protests were pacific. </ p>
    <p> After this incident the paralysis began to manifest, a day after that occurred in Feu Rosa, now reaching Great Victory, Linhares, Aracruz, Colatina and Piúma. In this paralysis was alleged the reason why this happened as the compensation of the police, who received no increase for years. They also required aid and benefits such as food, and even receive more for Hazards and Health. New waistcoats were also requested because they were in great shortage and the police fleets were in very poor condition. After all the damage caused by the occurrence, the families were asking for anistía of the families and the policemen that could be imposed judicially against them. The situation was even more critical when civil police also stated that they would strike 2 days later because of the death of a Civil Police Officer who was acting in the place of a Military Police Officer.</p>

On February 7, there were clashes between the civilians themselves. Groups of residents of the region went to the barracks to convince the demonstrators to vacate the place. Thus, residents protested demanding the return of policing. The army had to control the demonstration. </p>
<p> On February 10, representatives of the military police closed an agreement with the government to stop the movement. The negotiation ended without salary readjustment for the category, but it was agreed that the Government would give up the lawsuits against the associations, and form a commission to regulate the hours of the police. One of the demonstrators occupying the door of the Special Missions Battalion (BME), in Vitória, denied that the movement had ended after the meeting between associations and government. The following day, protesters ignored the agreement between the government and the associations, claiming the lack of legitimacy of the agreement. </p>
<p> On February 23, the State Court ordered that all persons blocking the Maruípe Barracks or the battalions of the Military Police be identified, summoned and summoned. The judge in charge authorized, in this case, the use of the police force. Those who did not leave the front of the battalions could be fined ten thousand reais a day. After a meeting with the State Government initiated on February 24, mediated by the Public Labor Ministry, there was consensus among the parties, so the women and family vacated the barracks on the morning of February 24. The first hearing to negotiate benefits was held on March 2. </p>
<p> On February 10, 2017, the Military Police of Espírito Santo indicted 703 military police officers for the crime of revolt, of which 327 the day before. If convicted, the penalty is 8 to 20 years of detention in military prison and the expulsion of the corporation. According to the Secretary of Public Security, André Garcia, these policemen had the cut off point and will not receive salary. The secretary reported that they were indicted for the military crime of revolt because they were armed and quartered in the battalions. Conduct of investigations will be carried out by the PM's Office.</p>
