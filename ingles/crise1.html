</a> and <a href="http://www.dicionarioinformal.com.br/salubridade/" title="Salubridade">Lubrication</a>. New waistcoats were also requested because they were in great shortage and that the police fleets were in very bad conditions of use. After all the damage caused by the occurrence, the families were asking for anistía of the families and the police that could be imposed judicially against them.

<p>On February 10, representatives of the military police closed an agreement with the government to stop the movement. The negotiation ended without salary readjustment for the category, but it was agreed that the Government would give up the lawsuits against the associations, and form a commission to regulate the hours of the police. One of the demonstrators occupying the door of the Special Missions Battalion (BME), in Vitoria, denied that the movement had ended after the meeting between associations and Government. The next day, protesters ignored the agreement between the government and the associations, alleging the lack of legitimacy of the agreement.</p>
