   institute of Espirito Santo (IFES) that came about through a work proposed by our web programming teachers, 
   in which there was a relation with another work of history where we could Choose certain themes that should have 
   something involving our state. And through this came the idea of ​​creating such a site, especially for the fact that 
   happened in our state, which was the police strike that happened at the beginning of this year (2017), we felt it on our 
   skin and so we would like to show it to others Areas of Brazil and pro Mundo. But to make a page on the internet, we would

   and so we did the site, if you want to contact to report some error or to give us new ideas for
   the site is just click on contacts there above, our chats for access.</p>
